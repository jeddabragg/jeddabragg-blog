As a recent web dev bootcamp grad my mind is still reeling from everything that I just learned. The tech world is moving at a breakneck speed. So what should I be doing now? Do I need to learn something else like machine learning or data analytics? SASS? Python? Should I get back to the fundamentals I was taught to move myself forward with confidence? I am choosing the latter.

There are all kinds of opportunities out there and everything sounds interesting and very important to learn. I want to root myself in what is important and once I have the basics down then decide where I want to go from there.

I’ve been practicing with react and the useState hook has been important for web applications and developing components. But what is state? To better grasp that I want to create a text based adventure game with javascript to help my mind wrap around that idea. It will provide plenty of practice with arrays, objects, and variables. Let’s see where it gets me.
